Add:
1.how to to run the script from the commend line - like in the following git : https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Action-Recognition
2. right now I downloaded the data locally and run the frame split. it was easier - wget commend didn't work on the windows.
3. Move the extract data from file to a new class and model
4. Don't really understand why they do all of this process to extract the data, its super long and I'm not sure it makes sense (fix it)
5. requirement list
6. Change the preprocessing data to multiprocessing using: (maybe need to remove from the pytorch script the lambda in the dl function)

7. maybe save as h5pq and not as an images so it will be lighter?
8. add requirement file
